Instead, we proceed by causal assumptions about how the world has assigned the treatment.\n\nWe focus here on designs relying on **selection on observables**: the assumption that counterfactual distributions are identified by factual distributions conditional on measured variables $\\vec{X}$.\n\n$$\n\\underbrace{(Y^a\\mid \\vec{X} = \\vec{x})}_{\\substack{\\text{Distribution of}\\\\\\text{Potential Outcome}\\\\\\text{Under Treatment Value }a\\\\\\text{Among }\\vec{X} = \\vec{x}}} \\underbrace{\\sim}_{\\substack{\\text{Is Distributed}\\\\\\text{The Same As}}} \\underbrace{(Y\\mid A = a, \\vec{X} = \\vec{x})}_{\\substack{\\text{Distribution of}\\\\\\text{Factual Outcome}\\\\\\text{Among Those With}\\\\A = a \\text{ and }\\vec{X} = \\vec{x}}}\n$$\n\nSometimes selection on observables is written as a statement of conditional independence: the distribution of the potential outcome is independent of the actual treatment assigned conditional on $\\vec{X}$.\n\n$$\nY^a ⫫ A\\mid \\vec{X}\n$$\n\n## Causal identification\n\nCausal identification is a mathematical proof linking a causal estimand (involving potential outcomes) to a statistical quantity involving only factual random variables. Causal identifiction is possible under selection on observables.\n\nFor example, suppose our estimand is survival at time $t$ that would be realized on average if exposed to treatment value $a$. The proof below begins with a causal estimand involving $Y^a$ and equates this (by assumptions) to a statistical estimand involving only $\\vec{X}$ and $Y$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{P}(Y^a > t) \n&= \\sum_{\\vec{x}} \\text{P}(Y^a>t\\mid\\vec{X} = \\vec{x})\\text{P}(\\vec{X} = \\vec{x}) &\\text{by law of total probability} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{\\vec{x}} \\text{P}(Y>t\\mid \\vec{X} = \\vec{x}, A = a)\\text{P}(\\vec{X} = \\vec{x}) &\\text{by selection on observables}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n## When does selection on observables hold?\n\n> This section is an abbreviated review of a topic from 212B.\n\nSelection on observables rests on causal assumptions about why the treatment $A$ is statistically related to the outcome $Y$. You might think of two main reasons.\n\n1. $A$ causes $Y$\n2. A variable $X$ causes both $A$ and $Y$\n3. (Note that other reasons can exist beyond these two, but we will focus on these two initially)\n\nSelection on observables seeks to rule out all non-causal sources of association (e.g., 2) and isolate the causal effect of interest (1).\n\nHow do we isolate a causal source? As an example, suppose that $A$ and $Y$ are associated only from sources 1 and 2 above: a causal effect $A\\rightarrow Y$ and a common cause $A\\leftarrow X \\rightarrow Y$. Suppose we carry out analysis on a subgroup taking the value $X = x$. Within this subgroup, every unit has the same value of $X$. The common-cause source (2) cannot create an association between $A$ and $Y$ in this subgroup. Thus, any remaining association between $A$ and $Y$ within the subgroup must arise from the causal effect (source 1). Conditioning on $X$ isolates this causal source and thus identifies the causal effect.\n\nDirected Acyclic Graphs (DAGs, [Pearl 2000](https://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/)) are a mathematical tool that (among other uses) can help to reason about when selection on observables will hold. To use a DAG, one first:\n\n* formalizes causal beliefs in a visual graph with nodes representing variables and arrows representing causal effects\n* lists all paths between the treatment $A$ and the outcome $Y$\n* crosses off paths blocked when conditioning on $\\vec{X}$\n* determines whether the remaining paths are causal\n\nThis was a topic covered extensively in Soc 212B, so I am not covering it extensively here to avoid duplication. For those curious, the materials on DAGs are available [here](https://ilundberg.github.io/soc212b/nonparametric_identification.html#nodes-edges-and-paths).\n",
