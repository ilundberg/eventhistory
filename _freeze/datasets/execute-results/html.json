Each person (indexed by `id`) has four rows corresponding to four outcomes: high school completion, BA completion, marriage, and first birth.\n\n-   `id` is the person identifier\n-   `sex` is a covariate from the baseline interview\n-   `race` is a covariate from the baseline interview\n-   `outcome` is the outcome that the row summarizes: `educ_hs` for high school completion, `educ_ba` for college, `married` for first marriage, and `parent` for first birth\n-   `time` is the age in years at which the outcome occurs, or the unit is censored\n-   `censored` is an indicator variable coded `FALSE` if the outcome occurs and `TRUE` if the unit was censored: the last interview happened without the event occurring. For units with `censored = TRUE`, the `time` variable is the age at the last interview.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnlsy_outcomes <- read_csv(\"https://ilundberg.github.io/eventhistory/assets/nlsy_outcomes.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nWhen analyzing these data, you should first filter the data to a single value of `outcome` that you plan to study. The figure below shows Kaplan-Meier survival curves for these four outcomes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](datasets_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Employment duration\n\nThis dataset can be used to model the duration of an employment spell as a function of covariates defined at the beginning of the spell.\n\nThe file [assets/employment_duration.csv](employment_duration.csv) contains data from the [NLSY97](https://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy97.htm) cross-sectional sample (excluding oversamples). Each row is a (person $\\times$ employment spell). Variables are defined as follows:\n\n-   `id` is a person identifier\n-   `time` is the duration of the employment spell in years. It begins with the month a respondent moves from being non-employed to being employed at least one week. It ends with the month a respondent becomes non-employed again for an entire month.\n-   `censored` is an indicator for being censored, coded `TRUE` if the last interview occurred during this employment spell and `FALSE` if the end of the employment spell was observed\n-   Two covariates are defined at the baseline survey: `sex` and `race`\n-   Four covariates are defined at the start of the employment spell: `age`, `education`, `marital`, and `parent` (whether the respondent is a parent)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nemployment_duration <- read_csv(\"https://ilundberg.github.io/eventhistory/assets/employment_duration.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThe figure below shows a Kaplan-Meier survival curve for first marriage duration in these data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](datasets_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## First marriage duration\n\nThis dataset can be used to model the duration of a first marriage as a function of covariates defined at the beginning of the marriage. It can also be used to reason about competing risks, because marriages end for several reasons recorded in the `how_end` variable.\n\nThe file [assets/first_marriage_duration.csv](first_marriage_duration.csv) contains data from the [NLSY97](https://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy97.htm) cross-sectional sample (excluding oversamples). Each row is a person who reports the start of a first marriage.\n\n-   `id` is a person identifier\n-   `censored` is an indicator for being censored, coded `TRUE` if the last interview occurred while the respondent was still married and `FALSE` if otherwise (i.e., end of marriage was observed)\n-   `time` is the duration of the first marriage in years, until either the end of the marriage or censoring\n-   `how_end` is how the marriage ended: `Censored`, `Divorced`, `Legally Separated`, or `Widowed`\n-   Two covariates are defined at the baseline survey: `sex` and `race`\n-   Three covariates are defined at the start of the first marriage: `age`, `education`, and `parent` (whether the respondent is a parent)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfirst_marriage_duration <- read_csv(\"https://ilundberg.github.io/eventhistory/assets/first_marriage_duration.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThe figure below shows a Kaplan-Meier survival curve for first marriage duration in these data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](datasets_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n",
