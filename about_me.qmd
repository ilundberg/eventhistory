I am a sociologist and demographer working on developing quantitative methods to understand inequality. Survival analysis is a topic where you can quickly learn how to develop new models using Maximum Likelihood Estimation, so I hope this course will be a chance to think like a methodologist and develop new approaches tailored to your setting. Outside of work I enjoy hiking, surfing, and oatmeal with blueberries.

I learned survival analysis in a course taught by Germán Rodriguez. Some of my materials are inspired by those materials available [here](https://grodri.github.io/survival/).
